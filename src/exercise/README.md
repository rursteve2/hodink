# Instructions for HODINKEE Front End Exercise

## Overview

You have been tasked with recreating a teaser page for an upcoming limited edition watch that will be hosted on limited.hodinkee.com. The teaser page is critical in generating interest and collecting email addresses.

## Included files

Included in this folder are several files. To see a finished version of what you are aiming to recreate, see `finished-desktop.jpg` and `finished-mobile.jpg`.

For the actual design file, please import `designs.fig` into Figma. You can create a free Figma account [here](https://www.figma.com/pricing/).

Fonts used have been included as .woff files located in the fonts folder.

Finally, there are a couple image files. `bg-2440.jpg`, `bg-1440.jpg`, `bg-720.jpg`, `bg-mobile.jpg`, and `logo.png`.

## Guidelines

HODINKEE users enjoy our content on all kinds of devices and screen sizes. For that reason we stress the importance of having all of our designs responsive and adaptive. That being said, here are a few things we are looking for in this design that may not be immediately obvious:

-   The HODINKEE logo, date, and form should be both vertically and horizontally centered on the page regardless of viewport height.
-   The background image should take up the entire width and height of the viewport.
-   The background image src should be responsive. A few sizes have been provided for you to use at certain breakpoints. Mobile viewports should use `bg-mobile.jpg`.
-   The "< H SHop" navigation item should link to `https://shop.hodinkee.com`
-   The form does not have to post anywhere, but when submitted should display a message underneath stating `Thank you for your interest!`. The styling for this is left for you to decide.
-   The share button does not have to be functional
-   The fonts should be correct, there should only be two custom fonts used. Brown Std Regular, and Portrait Medium Italic. Both can be located in the fonts folder included.

## Tools

There are only two rules in building this project:

-   It must be in React.
-   It must be installable and runnable by using `yarn && yarn start` or `npm && npm start`. A good starting point for this would be [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), or we personally recommend [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Other than that, you can use any third party libraries you wish. Feel free to use SASS or CSS modules as well.

## Judgement

After submission we will review your code and then schedule a call to go over it. You should be prepared to explain and justify decisions that you made. In addition to overall code quality, we will also be looking for:

-   Load time performance.
-   Accessibility concerns.
-   Code structure and organization.
-   Readable code. Don't worry about littering your code with comments, it should be self explanatory.

## Extra credit

Bonus points for adding nice flourishes such as subtle animations like fading in the images, parallax effects on the form, hover effects etc...
